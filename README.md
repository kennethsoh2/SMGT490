# SMGT 490 Capstone Project

This is a repository for my SMGT 490 course. In this project, I am examining the following research question:

**How do player skill traits interact with the extreme run environment of Coors Field, and which types of hitters and pitchers are best suited to perform well there compared to league-average parks?**
